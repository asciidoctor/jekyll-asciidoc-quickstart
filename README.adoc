= Jekyll AsciiDoc Quickstart
:experimental:
ifndef::env-github[:toc:]

The Jekyll AsciiDoc Quickstart project provides a quick way to set up an AsciiDoc-based website using GitHub's publishing infrastructure.
This project combines the power of AsciiDoc with an elegant CSS foundation and a blog-ready template.
Since it's a repository template, all you need to do is create a new repository from this repository to create your website.

The project provides a GitHub Actions workflow that publishes your website whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
The workflow watches for commits on the *main* (or *master* branch), automatically runs the Jekyll build with the AsciiDoc plugin enabled, and pushes the generated content to the *gh-pages* branch, from which it is hosted.

You can find a live website created from this repository at https://asciidoctor.github.io/jekyll-asciidoc-quickstart.

== Create Your Website

=== Use the Template and Activate GitHub Pages

. Click the green btn:[Use this template] button in the upper right corner of GitHub and select *Create a new repository* to create your own copy of this repository (i.e., fork).
** After the process is complete, you'll be directed to your fork.
** The first GitHub Actions workflow will fail since GitHub Pages is not yet enabled in your fork.
. Access the menu:Settings[] tab, then the menu:Pages[] menu on the left.
. In the *Source* field, select the btn:[Github Actions] option.
. Click the btn:[Save] button to apply the changes.
. Navigate to menu:Actions[] tab, click "Publish to GitHub Pages", click btn:[Run Workflow], then click btn:[Run workflow].

=== Verify the Build/Publish

After every push, the GitHub Action workflow is automatically started to build and publish your website.
That takes a while.
You can look for âœ… at the top of your repository home page.

If you can load the URL at `\https://github-username.github.io/name-of-repository`, then you have successfully completed the basic configuration.
Start writing blog posts and enjoy the AsciiDoc difference, regardless of what device you choose: computer, tablet, or mobile.

== Run your Website Locally

You must install some software to build and serve your website locally.
The requirements on the https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/[Jekyll Installation] page describe how to install both Ruby and RubyGems.

If you would like to work offline first, consider checking your `Gemfile` for the versions of your gem sources.
If the `jekyll serve` command fails, it likely means you don't have the necessary gems installed
You can check whether the `jekyll` gem is installed locally by running `gem list --local | grep "jekyll"`.

== GitHub Pages and AsciiDoc

GitHub Pages does not (yet) whitelist the jekyll-asciidoc plug-in, so you can not write `.adoc` posts and have them instantly published like Markdown posts do.
However, the only additional thing we need is the link:.github/workflows/publish.yml[publish.yml] workflow which is already configured in this repository.
You don't have to change it, unless you want to perform some customization in the build/publish process.

=== Help Get AsciiDoc Whitelisted for GitHub Pages

You can help change the lack of native AsciiDoc support by creating a support case through https://github.com/support.
This way, we won't need a GitHub Action workflow anymore to publish AsciiDoc websites.

Tell the GitHub team that you want the choice to write in AsciiDoc, and have it handled the same way Markdown is when pushed to your GitHub Page.

Your voice counts: make it heard!

== Repository Structure

The repository requires the following structure to work correctly:

* *main* or *master* (legacy), for markup sources and configuration.
This branch can be named anything you choose, however *main* is a general standard used in Jekyll blogs.
* _.github/workflows/publish.yml_ GitHub Action workflow to build the site and publish it to GitHub Pages.
